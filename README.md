# Shipment Rerouting: Classical vs Quantum Algorithms

This repository contains code for experiments comparing classical and quantum approaches to the shipment rerouting problem on real-life transportation networks.

üìÑ **Paper Reference**: These experiments were conducted as part of a study comparing classical optimization algorithms with quantum algorithms using real-world data.

## üß™ Experimental Setup

### Networks Used
Experiments are conducted across the following five transportation networks:

| Network              | # Nodes | # Edges |
|----------------------|---------|---------|
| Eastern Massachusetts| 74      | 258     |
| Anaheim              | 416     | 914     |
| Chicago              | 933     | 2950    |
| Winnipeg             | 1052    | 2836    |
| Barcelona            | 1020    | 2552    |

### Input Generation

- Truck runs are randomly generated from each network.
- Candidate routes are computed via depth-first search from each shipment‚Äôs source to destination.
- Each shipment is limited to **five candidate routes** to manage complexity.

### Input Sizes

- **Small-scale tests**: 30, 50, 80, 100 runs
- **Large-scale tests**: 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024 runs
  - Large tests require **IBM CPLEX Optimization Studio**.
